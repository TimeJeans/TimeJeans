- 👋 Hi, I’m @TimeJeans
- 👀 I’m interested in creating applications with Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, AWS cloud deployment and how to use Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects I could use to develop and grow my skills as a programmer, the more challenging the better.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm currently reading Wu Dong Qian Kun..
